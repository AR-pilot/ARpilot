# ARpilot

**ARpilot - Supply Clicker**

Press '0' to enable or disable the UI.

There are hotkeys for supplies clicking (1, 2, 3, 4) and Mining (5).

You can customize your hotkeys.

Have fun!

## Usage

### Initial Setup

This is the ARpilot startup screen when you install it for the first time:

### Activating Supply Buttons

ARpilot with the supply buttons active. Note that this alone is not sufficient for functionality - ARpilot requires a superstate to be enabled:

### Enabling Superstate

By default, you can use shortcut keys with the commands shown in the image. These can be found in the 'Settings' tab:

- `Digit8` - Enable the supplies superstate

### Developer Mode & Key Configuration

In the Settings tab, you can find the 'Developer Mode' function. Use this feature to change the click keys:

- If your game uses key `5` to drop a mine, ensure it's synchronized with ARpilot

**IMPORTANT**: Never use the same synchronization key with the shortcuts to activate supplies, as this may cause bugs.

### Automation Settings

In the Actions tab, you can automate the duration your clicks will remain active:
